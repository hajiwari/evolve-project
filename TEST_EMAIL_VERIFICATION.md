# Email Verification Test Guide

## What I Fixed:

1. **Removed Firestore Dependencies**: Temporarily removed Firestore operations that were causing 400 errors due to missing database configuration
2. **Fixed Email Verification URLs**: Changed from complex in-app handling to simple redirect to login page
3. **Simplified Flow**: Streamlined the signup process to be more reliable
4. **Added Favicon**: Fixed the 404 favicon error
5. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback

## How to Test Email Verification:

1. **Go to the signup page** (`/signup`)
2. **Fill out the form** with a real email address you can access
3. **Complete all steps** until you reach the verification step
4. **Check your email** for the verification link from Firebase
5. **Click the verification link** - it should redirect you to the login page with a success message
6. **Try to login** - you should now be able to sign in successfully

## Current Flow:

1. User fills signup form → 
2. Firebase creates account → 
3. Firebase sends verification email → 
4. User clicks email link → 
5. Firebase verifies email automatically → 
6. User can now login

## Next Steps (when Firestore is properly configured):

- Re-enable user profile storage in Firestore
- Add additional user metadata saving
- Implement more robust verification status checking

## Important Notes:

- The Firestore errors were caused by trying to write to a database that isn't properly configured
- Email verification now works through Firebase's built-in system
- Users must verify their email before they can sign in
- The signup process is now more reliable and follows Firebase best practices
